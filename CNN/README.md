# Multiple Classification

A very simple Convolutional Neural Network. You only need to provide:

- the location of the "train" - folder
- if you like to use colored images or gray images
- used Image-Size
- epochs
- learning rate

### Train - Folder

- it should contain for each class a seperate folder 
- each folder should be named after the class 

### Output 

1. the trained model
2. an image of randomly chosen images and their predictions

<img src="images/predictions.png" alt="" width="400" />

### not used:

- data augmentation
- early stoping
- reduction of LearningRate on Plateau
